# Cycle
Cycle is a game where the players try to cut each other off using cycles that leave a trail behind them.

Rules
Cycle is played according to the following rules.

Players can move up, down, left and right...
Player one moves using the W, S, A and D keys.
Player two moves using the I, K, J and L keys.
Each player's trail grows as they move.
Players try to maneuver so the opponent collides with their trail.
If a player collides with their opponent's trail...
A "game over" message is displayed in the middle of the screen.
The cycles turn white.
Players keep moving and turning but don't run into each other.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer and pygame installed and running on your machine. 
You can install pygame by opening a terminal and running the following command:
